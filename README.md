- `clicker.py` - Web automation for form submission
- `obtain_captcha.py` - CAPTCHA solving using OpenAI Vision
- `validate_IC.py` - Singapore IC/FIN validation
- `user_data.json` - Stores user information (created automatically)

## Data Storage

User data is stored in JSON format with the following structure:
```json
{
  "telegram_user_id": {
    "ic": "S1234567A",
    "dob": "01/01/1990",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Privacy & Security

- The bot includes PDPA compliance notices and privacy policy links
- User data can be deleted at any time using `/delete`
- PDFs are automatically cleaned up after sending
- User data is stored locally in JSON format
- Health declaration ensures compliance with entry requirements

## Health Declaration

Users must confirm they:
- Have no symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, etc.)
- Have not visited countries with Yellow Fever risk in the past 6 days

If either condition is true, users are directed to submit manually on the ICA website.

## Notes

- The bot automatically determines if the user is a resident (NRIC starting with S/T) or foreigner (FIN starting with F/G)
- PDFs are generated with the user's actual email address
- The bot handles both new registrations and updates to existing information
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Security Considerations

- Keep your bot token and OpenAI API key secure
- The `user_data.json` file contains sensitive information (IC numbers, DOB, emails)
- Consider implementing encryption for stored data in production
- Regular backups of user data are recommended
- Monitor bot usage for any suspicious activity
